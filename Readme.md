# Bookstore

Bookstore is a demo application for Rhetos development platform.
This project can be used as a *prototype* for new Rhetos applications,
regarding its project structure and content.

For the most part, this application is developed by following tutorial articles
from official [Rhetos Wiki](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/wiki).

The Bookstore application in this demo is **a business service** (Bookstore.Service)
that implements business features and database.

* It does not contain front-end implementation. This is typically a part of the N-tier
  enterprise system where a front-end is developed as a separate application
  (for example, an Angular web app).
* It exposes all business features through REST API.
  Other web protocols can be included with additional Rhetos plugins packages,
  or by implementing custom controllers.

## Build and initial setup

Initial database setup:

* Create an empty test database and enter the database connection string
  in the machine-specific configuration file `src\Bookstore.Service\rhetos-app.local.settings.json`.
  You can find the template for that file in `tools\Configs\Templates`.

To build the application from source, run `.\Build.ps1` and `.\Test.ps1` in PowerShell console.

## Run the application

Open Bookstore.sln in Visual Studio, right-click project "Bookstore.Service" and select "Set as Startup Project".
Start the web application in Visual Studio with Debug => Start Debugging **(F5)**.

* Web browser should open automatically, displaying Swagger UI with available REST API methods.

Testing in web browser:

* To test the application, in the browser append `/rest/Common/Claim/` to the base URL.
  It should return a list of records from the database table Common.Claim in JSON format.
* Note that **anonymous** authentication is configured by default.
  User authentication may be added to the application in order to test Rhetos authorization features
  such as row permissions.

## Project structure (Bookstore.sln)

* **Bookstore.Service** - Main application (business service).
* Bookstore.Service.Test - Unit tests and integration tests.
* Bookstore.Concepts - Custom concepts library that extend Rhetos DSL programming language
  with features specific to this application.
* Bookstore.Playground - Example of a command-line utility that uses the generated business
  object model from Bookstore.Service.

Aside from the project structure, please note the following key components that
most Rhetos applications should contain:

1. The build script `Build.ps1`, that does everything needed to produce the application binaries from the source in command prompt,
   such as verifying installed prerequisites and running dotnet build.
   * Note that the build script disables automatic database updated with `-p:RhetosDeploy=False`,
     in order to cleanly separate building binaries from testing phase.
     The database is updated later in `Test.ps1` by running `rhetos.exe dbupdate`.
     See [Rhetos CLI documentation](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/wiki/Rhetos-CLI#msbuild-integration-with-rhetosmsbuild-nuget-package) for more info.
2. The test script `Test.ps1`, that updates the database, runs the automated unit tests and the integration tests.

## Unit testing

Automated tests are executed by running `.\Test.ps1` in PowerShell console.

The tests are located in projects *Bookstore.Service.Test*, within Bookstore solution.

There are two kinds of tests in this project:

1. **Standard unit tests**
   that test the features implemented in stand-alone classes and methods, without accessing the database.
    * These tests are very fast and independent of the deployment environment.
    * For example see RatingSystemTest class.
2. **Integration tests**
   that test the application together with the database.
    * These tests can test full business processes, including the business logic
      that is implemented in the database, but are slower and need a database to run
      (the database connection is set up in the application settings).
    * For example see BookTest class.

There are some important considerations for the integration tests
that we apply to keep their complexity under control:

* Each test should insert its own data and not rely on pre-existing data in the database,
  or on the data inserted by other tests.
* Each test should clear its data when finished.
  This is done automatically by `TestScope`: SQL transaction is rolled back by default
  at the end of the `using` block, unless `CommitAndClose` method is called on the scope
  (at the end of the using block).
* The tests should not be affected by the existing data in the database.
  They can be executed on an empty database (after the application is deployed to it),
  or on a database with some data previously entered by user.

Before creating a pull request, please run `tools\Build\Test-CleanBuild.ps1` in PowerShell console,
to make sure there are not any errors when running a clean full build without cached output binaries.
